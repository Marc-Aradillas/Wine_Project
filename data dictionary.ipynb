    "|Fixed Acidity       |   Float  | The amount of tartaric acid in wine, which is found in grapes (measured in g/dm³). |\n",
    "| Volatile Acidity          | Float  | The amount of acetic acid in wine, which at high levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar-like taste. |\n",
    "| Citric Acid   |  Float    | Found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines.|\n",
    "| Residual Sugar|  Float    | The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops (measured in g/dm³). |\n",
    "|Chloride      |   Float  | The amount of salt in the wine (measured in g/dm³). |\n",

    "| Total sulfar dioxide | Float | Amount of free and bound forms of SO₂ (measured in mg/dm³).|\n",
    "| Density  | Float  | The density of wine is close to that of water depending on the alcohol and sugar content (measured in g/cm³).|\n",
    "| PH|  Float   |  Describes the acidity or basicity of the wine on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4.\n",

    "|Sulphates      |  Float   |A wine additive that contributes to SO₂ gas levels, which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant (measured in g/dm³).|\n",

    "| Quality  |  Float   | A score between 0 and 10 given to the wine sample. |\n"
